# Design and Analysis Algorithm Lab

This repository contains implementations and analysis for a variety of algorithms typically covered in a Design and Analysis of Algorithms course. The projects here showcase different algorithmic strategies with sample code, problem statements, and analysis details.

## Repository Structure

- **Back Tracking**  
  Contains implementations that explore recursive problem-solving techniques through backtracking.

- **Brute Force**  
  Includes straightforward solutions that exhaustively search for answers.

- **DP (Dynamic Programming)**  
  Features algorithms that use overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure to optimize solutions.

- **Divide And Conquer**  
  Implements algorithms that break problems into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine the results.

- **Greedy Method**  
  Contains examples of greedy strategies that make the optimal local choice at each step.

Additional files:

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be excluded from version control.
- **CovexHull.pdf**: A document that supplements the implementations.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Languages and Tools

- **C**: Majority of the implementations are in C, offering efficient low-level solutions.
- **Java**: Some modules are written in Java, providing a different perspective on algorithm design.
